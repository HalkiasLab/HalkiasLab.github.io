description: "Veronica graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in biological sciences. During her undergraduate summers she worked for [Pivot Bio] (https://www.pivotbio.com/) where she engineered microbial fertilizers to fix nitrogen for corn crops.

As the first hire to the Halkias Lab, Veronica has worked on a broad range of projects, but is currently studying ways in which the fetal intestinal environment contributes to the maturation and regulation of protective T cell populations in utero."
