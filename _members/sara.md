description: "Sara graduated from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo with a degree in Biology and a minor in Biotechnology. As an undergraduate, she studied reproductive timing and environmental correlates in Pismo clam populations under the guidance of Dr. Benjamin Ruttenberg. While she loved her time conducting marine biology research, she was more interested in pursuing a career in immunology.


In the Halkias Lab at UCSF, Sara studies interactions between fetal thymocytes and APCs, microbial lysates, and many different cytokines in an attempt to understand what signals drive the accumulation and functional potential of inflammatory fetal T cells. When sheâ€™s not in the lab, Sara enjoys hiking, going to the beach, and yoga."
