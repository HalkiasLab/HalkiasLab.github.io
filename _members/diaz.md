description: "Robbie graduated from the University of Miami with a degree in Neuroscience. He studied how transcription factors regulate axon regeneration in the central nervous system as an undergraduate in Dr. Vance Lemmon's lab.


Robbie is interested in utilizing biochemical and structural techniques to study interactions between chitin-binding proteins and chitin. When he's not in lab, Robbie is promoting DEI efforts, reading books (or sometimes tweets), or enjoying a San Francisco park.


Robbie is supported by graduate fellowships from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and [HHMI](http://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/gilliam-fellowships-advanced-study/)."
