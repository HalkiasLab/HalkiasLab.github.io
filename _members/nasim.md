description: "Nasim completed her Phd at The University of Texas at El Paso where she studied extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the causative agent of Chagas disease (ChD). She isolated and characterized T. cruzi EVs through proteomic, lipidomic, and immunoassays, and tested how EVs assist T. cruzi parasite in its pathogenesis in vitro. Through this work she  acquired experience with pathogens and their interaction with the immune system, immunoassays and advanced microscopy, as well as good experience in proteomics analysis, and biostatistics, and basic experience in spectral flow cytometry and mice handling.


In the Halkias Lab she is studying the etiological factors involved in preterm birth, with the focus on inflammatory immune response - particularly T cell activation - and its association with pregnancy complications and preterm birth.


Outside of lab she enjoys reading, meditating, doing yoga, and creating cooking recipes. She enjoys watching comedies and drama as well as following NEWS. She also loves traveling and hope this ongoing pandemic gets controlled so she can get to some overdue sightseeing."
