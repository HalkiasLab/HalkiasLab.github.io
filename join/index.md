## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/prospective-students) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab.

##### The Halkias Lab participates in the following UCSF graduate program:
  * **[Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program](https://bms.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BMS) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)  is an interdisciplinary graduate research program that seeks to equip students with the training and research tools to study the function of tissue and organ systems in development, physiology, and disease.

## Postdoctoral Fellows
