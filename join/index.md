## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/prospective-students) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab.

##### The Fraser Lab participates in the following UCSF graduate program:
  * **[Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program](https://bms.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (BMS) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)  is an interdisciplinary graduate research program that seeks to equip students with the training and research tools to study the function of tissue and organ systems in development, physiology, and disease.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to Joanna Halkias. Candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Other Visitors

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac technicians in the lab.  We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. Note: we take high school students exclusively through the [UCSF SEP program](http://sep.ucsf.edu/).
