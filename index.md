# Welcome to the Halkias Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
wahoo!!!! [Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences](http://bts.ucsf.edu/), the [Macromolecular Structure Group](http://msg.ucsf.edu/), and the [California Institute of Quantitative Biosciences (QB3)](http://qb3.org/). 
{: .welcomefont}

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.

We are located in The at the Parnassus Campus of UCSF.
